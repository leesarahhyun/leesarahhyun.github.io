            <h2>A Collections Transformation</h2>
            <p> Collections on Instagram was implemented in 2017 as an extension of Saved Photos. As an Instagram user and an avid Collections user myself, with some usage and research, I believe that the Collections experience could be made more seamless by redesigning the way posts can be removed from one's Collection. As a bonus, I also think that Collections can be made more personable to users by implementing an extra feature mentioned down below!</p>

            <br>
            <p>&#129349; Re-design the Collections feature on Instagram to be more <span class="mediumBold">personable and seemless</span>.</p>

            <h2>CONCEPTS INVOLVED:</h2>
            <p>UX Research, Design, Prototyping</p>

            <p>&#9996; UX Designer</p>
          </div>
        </div>



        <div class="caseStudyTitleContainer">
          <h2> BACKGROUND </h2>
          <p>According to an article on <i>SearchEngineJournal</i>, a majority of Instagram's users fall between the ages of <span class="mediumBold">18~34</span>. Given that most college students are usually between this age, I interviewed three students from the University of California, San Diego, to gain insight on improvements that could be made with the Collections feature on Instagram.</p>

          <p> As part of the interview, I had my interviewees accomplish a simple user task in order to see how familiar the interviewees were with the Collections feature and to identify any slips or mistakes that can be improved.</p>

          <p> The user tasks were as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a Collection titled <i>"My Collection."</i></li>
            <li>Add any 3 posts to <i>"My Collection."</i></li>
            <li>Delete a post saved in <i>"My Collection."</i></li>
          </ol>
        </div>


        <div class="caseStudyTitleContainer">
          <h2>PART 1: DETAILING THE PROBLEMS &#10024;</h2>

          <p> Through the interviews, I've been able to identify the following problems:</p>

              <div class="igGridDescription">
                <p>While the first two user tasks seemed to be fairly simple for users to accomplish, the third user task was a bit trickier due to the <span class="mediumBold">similarity of the <span class="underline">Select...</span> and <span class="underline">Edit Collection</span> options</span>. During the third user task, the users often navigated straight to the <span class="underline">Edit Collection</span> option.</p>

                <p>However, the <span class="mediumBold">right course of action</span> should have been for users to <span class="mediumBold">navigate straight to the <span class="underline">Select...</span> option</span>, in order to properly select and delete posts from <i>"My Collection."</i></p>

                <br>
                <b>IN THE REDESIGN</b>, consolidating the 'Select...' option into the 'Edit Collection' option provides users with a <span class="mediumBold">simpler understanding</span> of the options available.</p>

                <p> <b>PREVIOUSLY</b>, there was some discrepancy in the saved post removal process where removing a post directly from a Collection didn't mean that it got removed entirely from your Saved Posts.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>IN THE REDESIGN</b>, to resolve this discrepancy, users are presented with option to remove the post solely from a Collection or entirely from their Saved Posts. Users will no longer have to go through the extra step of manually untoggling the <img class="bookmarkIcon" src="image/instagram/bookmark1.png" alt="bookmark icon"> for each unwanted post nor do they have to check back and forth between a Collections folder and the Saved Posts folder to make sure that it was removed properly and they don't come across it in the future.</p>

                <p> <b>PREVIOUSLY</b>, saving posts to your Collection is organized chronologically depending on the time at which the user saved the post. Eventually as posts build up in your Collection, the overall feed can look really disorganized and random.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>IN THE REDESIGN</b>, I implemented a feature so that users can <span class="mediumBold">drag and drop posts within a Collection folder to re-order</span> just as they wish. This will allow users to better organize their Collections and personalize it just the way they like it!</p>

          <p>With Saved Posts becoming a new indication of how well posts are performing on Instagram, I think these redesigns will definitely aid to enhance the user experience of Instagram's Collection feature.

          Lately, Instgram considers Saved Posts the new indicator of how well posts perform. The Collecions</p>
