Hello, I'm Sarah! I attended the University of California, San Diego, where I graduated with a degree in Cognitive Science (specializing in design and interaction). My interests lie in the field of UI/UX, graphic design, and marketing! This is my personal website showcasing my UI/UX design projects, as well as other personal projects and illustrations!
